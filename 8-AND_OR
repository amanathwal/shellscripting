  #### && and || ###


  1. && = AND 
  
  mkdir /tmp/abc && cp test.txt /tmp/bak/

  command after AND will only execute if the previous command will succeed, means the status code is 0



2. || = OR
  
cp test.txt /tmp/abc/ || cp test.txt /tmp

only execute if the first command fails, means returns a non 0 status code


# you can chain mutiple commands on a single line by sperating with a ;, it doesnot check status codes, its same as putting them on seperate line
